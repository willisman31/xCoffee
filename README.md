Retrieve, process, and visualize tweet sentiment from cybersecurity voices

This project is broken up into three main components:

## Data Retrieval
The first part is to leverage Twitter's API to retrieve tweets from the infosec community; I have elected to begin with the Twitter accounts of SANS instructors as these are all known voices in the community with public and easily-retrieved twitter handles.

## Processing
The next step is to process the retrieved data to remove irrelevant tweets and highlight important or popular topics

## Visualization
The final step is to create a useful visualization so that this data can be quickly and easily understood
